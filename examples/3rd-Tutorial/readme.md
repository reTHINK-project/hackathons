# How to run

Use the Hyperty-Toolkit to encode the content of the `dev-hyperty` folder.

You can use the APP from the 1st example to test this hyperty.

##### Note: Do not forget that now you want to load the hyperty from the Hyperty-Toolkit (localhost) and not from the testbed (hybroker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt). Change the require method in the `client.js` file.
