2. Which parts of the reTHINK did you need to understand better to develop the hyperty?
3. Do you identify any part which would require a better documentation?
4. Do you understand how the syncher API works?
5. Do you find the reporter-observer pattern used for data exchange between hyperties helpful?
6. Do you understand the role of the Message Node?
7. Do you understand the role of the Registry domain?
8.Do you understand the role of the Catalogue node?
9. Is the provision of the Catalogue node easy?

11. Is the documentation of the developer toolkit complete and easy to follow?
12. Is there any unclear or missing point the hyperty developer toolkit documentation?
13. Did you manage to implement all the features of your application for phase 2?
14. If you answered "No" to the previous question, please let us know what features you tried to implement and was not possible.
15. Did you manage to debug your application easily during the development?
16. Is clearly defined the border between Application and hyperty code?
17. Did you find any limitation of the Identity Management features provided by the Runtime?
